# EtherFund - Crowdfunding DApp with Ethereum and React
EtherFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built using Ethereum blockchain and React.js. It allows users to create and fund projects, invest in existing ones, and receive funding through the use of smart contracts.

The front-end is developed using React.js, providing a modern and user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform. It integrates with the Ethereum blockchain through the use of the Web3.js library, enabling secure and efficient transactions without the need for a central authority.

This repository contains the source code for the front-end of the EtherFund DApp. It includes React components, styling, and other related files. Contributions are welcome, and encourage developers to join us in building a decentralized future for crowdfunding.
